# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
This is a summary of the analysis conducted using Tableau with NYC Citi Bike Data.
## Purpose
Provide actionable data for investors to decide if a bike sharing/renting program would be successful in Des Moines, based on NYC data as a comparison point. The key question centered around the population differences between the two cities and how that might affect business. 
## Method
Imported both the Citi Bike and Census data as separate files into Tableau Desktop.  These files were kept separate because they were in no way related. The purpose of the census data was to make a comparitive demographic analysis of NYC and Des Moines.
### Analysis
When looking at the NYC vs. Des Moines population demographics, there are several key points that might affect how to scale the business, best locations to set up, and pricing.  These are detailed in the two stories.
- Des Moines is a small city, situated in the MidWest, surrounded by other small cities. Refer to the map:

- It has a friendly, quaint vibe. I will provide some sources at the end of the document for you to visit and see.  It has invested impressive resources in attracting tourists.
- Per capita income is higher and poverty is lower in Des Moines, which may lead to more disposable income, combined with a lower cost of living.
- Des Moines already has over 600 miles of trails in its city and nearby. Here is an image to show how the trails line up:

- Starting points for renting should be located near well-known tourist attractions.  This was determined when looking at starting locations for bike renting in NYC.  Convenient drop off locations could be set up in various key points that are not too far from the starting points.
- Aim toward younger folks and families when marketing the business, as the NYC data shows that younger riders tend to keep the bikes longer.
### Conclusions
I think that opening a bike sharing business in Des Moines could be profitable, but should be scaled down and started up small to be sure that there is a robust market.  Given how Des Moines shows strong tourism trade, outsiders could also contribute to bike revenues.
